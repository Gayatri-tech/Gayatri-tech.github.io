              According to the Oxford dictionary, Success means the accomplishment of an aim or purpose. Now-a-days, Success is counted as the number of houses, cars, companies, prosperity,etc. The more money you have, the more successful person you are; but it's a misconception which is followed by most of the individuals. Money is an important aspect in success but it's not a necessity. The superstars, the wealthy people are considered as the successful people but that's not really true. According to me, Success is what by which we feel fully satisfied whether it is giving me fame or not, it doesn't matter. Success comes after a lot of hardwork,it is not a one day work. To be succeed in life, we need to sacrifice things which doesn't go in vain. It's not necessary that a wealthy person is a successful person. If you are fully satisfied with your life, then the digits of your salary doesn't matter. There are so many books and online videos are available which tells how to get success but in my opinion you will not get success until and unless you put daily efforts towards your goal. For achieving something in life, you need to be out of your comfort zone. In the journey of success, we get failures and sometimes we give up. We should be able to learn from our failures and should not sit behind them. To be succeed in life, the very first thing is to follow your passion, if you will follow your passion ,then there is no need of putting extra efforts because you will be enjoying doing it. Secondly, you need to be come out of your comfort zone and last but not the least you must be sincere towards your goal. Hence,according to me, a feeling of fulfillment is more powerful than wealth. In the last years of my life, I will be happier to say, "Yes!!! I did it. That's called a life." In this modern era, Social Media is playing a very important role in every individual's life. From children to parents, everyone is working as a permanent employee of the Social Media sites. At earlier times, there were no such things like Facebook, Whatsapp or Twitter ; people used to write letters and wait for long for the reply. Now, these social sites has made our life much easier and we can connect with any individual at any time from any place to any place in the world by just one click. The main aim of social networking sites was to connect to people, to share our opinions, to share knowledge but now-a-days the motive has seem to be changed. Social media helps in connecting with the people around the world. It helps in sharing our opinions in front of different people, helps in gaining knowledge from other's experiences,helps in finding people with whom we had lost our touch and helps in sharing information. Now-a-days, students are more active on these sites for their educational purpose, for their leisure time, for their projects,assignments,and to showcase their talents,etc. It quite has so many advantages if it is used in a right and effective way. Besides these positive aspects, Social media has create a different world of it's own. Increased use of these sites results in many online crimes like cyber bullying, stalking, online threats, hacking and fraud. The major impact on students is they got distracted due to these sites which results in their low grades. While studying , a single notification from Instagram, Facebook or any other site can affect one's study schedule. Social Media sites were came into market with a better purpose i.e. to make our life much easier. Now, the students are more likely dependent for every single thing on these social networking sites. The most important aim for a student is to study well and make a good career but these sites can destroy one's career in a second if it is not used properly. Every particular thing has it's positive side and negative side and we should adopt the positives and ignore the negatives.
